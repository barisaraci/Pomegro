<b> Pomegro - 2016 </b>
<hr>
Android branch of Pomegro, written in Java. Pomegro is a social media startup project that connects people each other via events. In Pomegro, after you choose your interests, the system matches you with the events related to your interests. Also, you can add other people as friend and follow what events they join in their daily life. In addition, besides the general newsfeed, which includes the general flow, such as friend requests, event invites, friends joining an event, etc.; there is a newsfeed for every single event. Thus, users can follow the event in its own feed which includes the snaps shared during the event.
